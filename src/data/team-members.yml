  description:
    - "<p>Denton the Dragon was born in a cave in the Bubble Mountains, not far from Pingletown, the largest city in Bubbleland.  Denton does not know how old he is, though he recalls two summers and two winters.  He can remember a pretty dragon smiling down at him when he was a baby.  He thinks that was his mother, but he does not know where she is now or what happened to any other dragons.  All he knows is that he has lived alone for as long as he can remember.</p>
    <p>Lots of people think that dragons can fly, but Denton has no wings and he cannot fly, no matter how hard he tries.<p>
    <p>When Denton lived in the mountains, he would roar as loud as he could so his roar would echo across the mountains and he could pretend other dragons were coming to see him.  After Little Rachel came to investigate and found Denton living alone, he came to live in her front yard in Pingletown.  Now he has lots of friends, but he still wishes there were other dragons.  His favorite color is green and his favorite food is fried furfels.  He is not afraid of anything, but is not fond of spiders.</p>"
